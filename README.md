# Social Media Engagement & "Zero Posting" Trend Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the impact of the **"Zero Posting" trend**—a phenomenon highlighted by Palki Sharma (FirstPost) where content gaps lead to significant drops in audience interaction.

Using a multi-tool approach (Python, Excel, Power BI), I analyzed social media data to quantify how consistency impacts reach and to identify the optimal posting schedule to recover lost engagement.

## 🛠 Tools & Workflow
The project follows a full lifecycle data analysis pipeline:
1.  **Data Collection (Kaggle):** Sourced raw, noisy interaction data.
2.  **Data Cleaning (Python):**  * Handled null values and unformatted dates.
    * Merged separate interaction tables into a master dataset.
    * Removed duplicates to prevent skew.
3.  **Statistical Analysis (Excel):**
    * Used the **Analysis ToolPak** for Descriptive Statistics and ANOVA.
    * Created Pivot Charts to spot preliminary patterns.
4.  **Dashboarding (Power BI):** * Built DAX measures for KPI tracking.
    * Visualized demographic and time-based trends.

## 💡 Key Insights
* **The "Zero Posting" Effect:** Consistent posting is critical; engagement metrics plummet during content gaps, confirming the hypothesis that "out of sight is out of mind."
* **Demographic Targeting:** surprisingly, **Senior Adult** audiences delivered the highest reach and engagement, contradicting the assumption that only Gen-Z drives social traffic.
* **Optimal Timing:** Engagement peaks during **Night and Afternoon** slots.
* **Day of Week:** **Weekdays** significantly outperform weekends for maximizing interaction.

## 🚀 Strategy Recommendations
Based on the data, the content strategy should pivot to:
* Eliminate "Zero Posting" gaps to maintain algorithmic favor.
* Schedule high-value content for weekday evenings.
* Tailor specific campaigns to the high-performing Senior Adult segment.
